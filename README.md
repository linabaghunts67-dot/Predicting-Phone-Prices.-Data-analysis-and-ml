Phone Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict smartphone prices based on various technical specifications.
The workflow includes data cleaning, missing value imputation, model training, and performance evaluation to identify the best-performing model.


Project Overview
In this project:

Cleaned and preprocessed a Kaggle dataset containing phone specifications and prices

Handled missing and null values using appropriate imputation techniques

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and price

Applied multiple machine learning models for price prediction

Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and R² score

Selected the best-performing model for final deployment


Technologies and Tools

Python

pandas, NumPy – for data processing

matplotlib, seaborn – for visualization

Jupyter Notebook – for analysis and development

etc


Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Description
Accuracy / R² Score	Measures how well the model fits the data
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)	Average of absolute prediction errors
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)	Penalizes larger errors
etc
F1 Score	Harmonic mean of precision and recall (for classification tasks)
